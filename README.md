This react app will display current and future (5 day, 3 hour interval) weather data about a specific city. This app is created using Javascript with the `React` frame work with [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) css framework for some components (styling,spacing,animation etc) for some css

### How to run 
This app has two different servers, one for the UI and another for the backend server. First you can cd in the the root folder and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- cd into the server folder and run `node server.js` to start the backend server to be able to call the third party API.
